    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the integration capabilities of roboquant with Alpaca. Alpaca is a new broker with an \"API-first\" approach, so a great fit for algorithmic trading. Besides being a broker that offers US stocks & crypto assets for trading, they also provide a nice data api. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://roboquant.org/img/thirdparty/alpaca.jpg\" alt=\"Alpaca\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood roboquant uses the excellent [alpaca-java](https://petersoj.github.io/alpaca-java/) library by jacob Peterson to do much of the heavy lifting. There are currently three types of integration available:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the historic data from Alpaca\n",
    "2. Use live data from Alpaca\n",
    "3. Use the Alpaca broker functionality (WIP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpaca has different subscription models which offer different functionality. This notebook should however run fine even with the free-tier and just the default paper-trading account.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run a very simple strategy since the focus is Alpaca integration for this notebook. But there are other notebooks available that focus on how to develop custom strategies and other aspect of roboquant like charting.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the required Alpaca classes are not imported, so we need to do that first. This will load the Feed and Broker classes for integrating with Alpaca"

And we create an instance of Roboquant with the strategy we just defined and some metrics to later see how we have done. Again this is all independent of the data feed we are going to use. Please note we create a very fast EMA (Exponential Moving Average) Crossover. Not a very common practice, but for the purpose of this demo we don't want to have to wait too long before any results can be observed.  "
