    "1. One or more currency pairs we are interested in. In this example we are interested in Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), both trading against the Binance USD (BUSD).\n",
    "> Please note how we defined a currency-pair: currency1-currency2\n",
    "2. The timeframe that we want to retrieve, in this case we select the past calendar 500 days.\n",

    "### Optional parameters\n",
    "There are also several optional parameters available:\n",

    "- Limit the number of candelsticks to be returned per currency pair, default is 1000\n",
