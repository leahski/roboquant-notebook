    "\n",
    "Our strategy adheres to the following 3 rules: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If it is a super moon => we buy stocks\n",
    "2. If it is a micro moon => we sell our stocks so we have no more exposure\n",
    "3. Otherwise => we do nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Btw, a supermoon occurs when the moonâ€™s orbit is closest to Earth at the same time it is full. So visually it is a very large moon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this example is obviously not to create a useful strategy that will make you a huge profit. But rather to demonstrate how easy it is to develop your own strategy.\n",
