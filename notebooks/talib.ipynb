    "# Technical Analysis using TaLib\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboquant comes out of box with support for technical analysis. It does this by having dedicate support for the popular technical analysis libraries TaLib. TaLib contains over 150 technical indicators. These are indicators ranging from RSI and Bollinger Bands to Candlestick pattern recognition. Directly using the TA-Lib library can be difficult due to its API, but roboquant makes it fairly easy by providing a convenient wrapper."

    "We start by defining the  strategy using TALib indicators we want to test in combination with the `TaLibStrategy` class. There are three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create an instance of `TaLibStrategy` and define how much history it should maintain before invoking the indicators. If you choose this value too low, certain indicators will fail and an exception will be thrown. For example if you want a moving average over 20 days, the history should be at least 20. If you choose the history value too large, it will take longer before your strategy starts to generate signals since it will wait until it has enough history. For many of the technical indicators like candle stick patterns, 15 is sufficient (also the default value).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Define what you logic to use for generating BUY signals. This can be a combination of indicators and you can also include regular Kotlin code. The only restriction is that the last statement has to be a boolean; true if you want to BUY, false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Define what you logic to use for generating SELL signals. The same rules and conditions apply as for the BUY method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that although not common practice, the framework doesn't stop you from using bullish indicators to generate a SELL signal and bearish indicators to generate a BUY signal. "
