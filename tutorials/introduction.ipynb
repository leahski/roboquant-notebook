    "\n",
    "Roboquant is a framework written in Kotlin for algoritmic trading. It enables robust back-testing and live trading in a fully automatic way. As an algo-trader, you can use roboquant in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a Jupyter Notebook \n",
    "- As a library in your standalone application using your IDE of choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Both share exactly the same code-base, so there is no difference how to develop your strategies or how they behave. The Notebook approach is a great to quickly be up and running and have a more iterative approach to developing new trading strategies. It comes also with charts that visualize how your strategy is poerformning. And as your strategy grows, you might benefit from the power of a full-fledged IDE like IDEA and move to a standolne application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows the very basics of using roboquant and how to test a simple strategy. We start with the cell magic **%use roboquant** to load the required packages. The **Welcome()** statement is optional, but gives some info on the environment we are running in.\n",

    "There several sensible default parameters for a roboquant, so the two main ingredients remaining to get started are:\n",

    "1. The strategy we want to test. For this example we use a Exponential Moving Average Crossover with its default settings. This comes out-of-the-box with roboquant.\n",
    "2. Any metrics we want to captured during the run to see how our strategy is performing. In this case we use the AccountSummary.\n",
