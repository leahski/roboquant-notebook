    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboquant is an open source algoritmic trading framework written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org). It enables fast and robust back-testing and live trading in a fully automatic way. You can read more about roboquant at [roboquant.org](https://roboquant.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an algo-trader, you can use roboquant in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a Jupyter Notebook \n",
    "2. As a library in your standalone Kotlin/Java application using your IDE of choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Both share exactly the same code-base, so there is no difference how to develop your strategies or how they behave. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The Notebook approach is a great to quickly be up and running and have a more iterative approach to developing new trading strategies. It comes also with charts that visualize how your strategy is performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As your strategy grows, you might benefit from the power of a full-fledged IDE like IDEA and move to a standalone application. Also if you want to run it for live-trading, the standalone application might prove a more robust approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates only the very basics of using roboquant and how to test a strategy. See the other included notebooks for a more advanced topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the cell magic **%use roboquant** to load the required packages. The **Welcome()** statement is optional, but gives usefull info on the environment we are running in."

    "# Define a Roboquant\n",
    "Besides the name of the software, the Roboquant class is also the engine of the framework. It ties all the components together that make-up a back-test. It also runs the actual tests and live trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "There several default parameters for a roboquant, so the only two main ingredients remaining that need to be defined to get started are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The strategy we want to test. For this example we use a Exponential Moving Average Crossover with its default settings. This comes out-of-the-box with roboquant.\n",
    "2. Any metrics we want to captured during the run to see how our strategy is performing. In this case we use the AccountSummary metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "roboquant allows for much more customization, but for this introduction notebook we'll keep it simple.  "
