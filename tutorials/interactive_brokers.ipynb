    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the integration of roboquant with Interactive Brokers (IBKR). \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Disclaimer: roboquant is not affiliated with Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.â€™s.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently 3 types of integration available:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use historic data from IBKR for back testing \n",
    "2. Use live data from IBKR for live testing \n",
    "2. Use the IBKR trading functionality (WIP) for paper trading\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "Make sure you always select paper trading account in your IB Gateway or Trader Workstation, since roboquant is still very much beta. If you didn't yet setup a paper trading account, click this <a href=\"https://ibkr.info/node/663\">article</a>  for some more info\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",

    "We'll run a very simple strategy since the focus is IBKR integration for this notebook. But there are other notebooks available that focus on how to develop custom strategies and other aspect of roboquant like charting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup and integration with IBKR is a more complicated than with other brokers. The two extra steps that are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.You cannot connect directly to an IBKR server. You will always need to run either ```IB Gateway``` or ```Trader Workstation```, and roboquant will connect to that instance. ```IB Gateway``` is the better option of the two, since it provides nice insights into the called API's and is less heavy weight. If you don't have it yet installed, you can download IB Gateway from [here](https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/en/index.php?f=16454)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because you need a running IB Gateway that is accessible, you won't be able to successfully run this notebook on public infrastructure like MyBinder.org or Datalore by JetBrains.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The TWS-API client cannot be packaged together with roboquant due to license constraints. So you'll have to download this file yourself, and then make it available to roboquant by uploading it to the tutorials directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Download the [TWS API client](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/downloads/twsapi_macunix.976.01.zip) from the IBKR website.\n",
    "    - Unzip the downloaded file and locate the file called ```TwsApi.jar```. It can be found at following path ```IBJts/source/JavaClient/TwsApi.jar``` inside the extracted folder.\n",
    "    - Upload this single jar file to the notebook directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, you can run the next cell and if no errors you are good to go."

    "# Back Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part shows how to retrieve historic prices and run a back test. In order to keep is simple we retrieve a single asset, but you can retrieve many assets and they will all be available during the back testing. \n",
    "Because IBKR offers data for many different assets in different markets, you need to specify what specific assets you are interested in. A simple symbol name won't be sufficient. For stock type of assets, at least supply the Symbol, Currency and possible the Exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Typically a paid subscription is required to receive market data from IBKR. Also IBKR has strict limitations on how often you can make an API call. So if you require high frequency market data for running your strategy, IBKR market data subscriptions might not be the best fit."
