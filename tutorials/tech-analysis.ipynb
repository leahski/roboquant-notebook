    "# TaLib based Strategy\n",
    "We start by defining the  strategy using TALib indicators we want to test in combination with the `TaLibStrategy` class. There are three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create an instance of `TaLibStrategy` and define how much history it should maintain before invoking the indicators. If you choose this value too low, certain indicators will fail and an exception will be thrown. For example if you want a moving average over 20 days, the history should be at least 20. If you choose the histoy value too large, it will take longer before your strategy starts to generate signals since it will wait untill it has enough history. For many of the technical indicators like candle stick patterns, 15 is sufficient (also the default value).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Define what you logic to use for generating BUY signals. This can be a combination of indicators and you can also include regular Kotlin code. The only restriction is that the last statement has to be a boolean; true if you want to BUY, false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Define what you logic to use for generating SELL signals. The same rules and conditions apply as for the BUY method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that although not common practice, the framework doesn't stop you from using bullish indicators to generate a SELL signal and bearish indicators to generate a BUY signal. "

    "\n",
    "We'll now will define a strategy using indicators and rules found in the `ta4j` library and the roboquant `Ta4jStrategy` strategy class. It allows to define flexible rules to generate BUY or SELL signals for assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find out more on using `ta4j` on the wiki site  https://ta4j.github.io/ta4j-wiki/Trading-strategies.html or visit the `ta4j` Discord server. Please note that indicators and rules from `ta4j` can be freely used and mixed, but defining strategies and back tests are done using roboquant constructs like the `Ta4jStrategy`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps to follow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the ta4j packages that you want to use (in future releases of roboquant this might be done automatically) \n",
    "2. Create a `Ta4jStrategy` instance and (optional) indicate how much history we want to track\n",
    "3. Define the buying and selling rules\n",
    "4. Run a back test and evaluate the results (this is not specific to `ta4j` based stategies)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important difference with `ta4j` back testing and `roboquant` is that in roboqaunt by default the buying and selling rules apply to all assets found in a feed. So in the below example the defined strategy is applied to all the S&P 500 stocks and not just a single stock. "
