This repository contains a number of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate howto use _roboquant_. The focus of each notebook is on a specific task, like howto visualize results or create technical analysis based strategies.

This repository also contains the build script to create a Docker image that makes it easy to run the Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine. This Docker image is published on https://hub.docker.com/r/roboquant/jupyter/tags[Docker Hub] for both Intel and ARM architecture, so you actually don't need to build the Docker Image yourself unless you want to make some changes.

You can find out much more about the _roboquant_ at *https://roboquant.org[roboquant.org]*

== Run Jupyter Notebooks
If you prefer, you can run the notebooks without installing anything on your local machine just by clicking the following link image:https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[Binder,link=https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks]

NOTE: It might take some time before the MyBinder environment is set up and you can run the notebooks. This is mainly due to the limited resources that these free environments have available and the fact that the Kotlin kernel isn't included by default and needs to be build first.


Alternatively you can run a Docker container on your local machine that has all the notebooks included and will automatically spin-up a Jupyter Lab environment:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 roboquant/jupyter
----

See link:bin/README.adoc[Docker README] for more options and details.

== Included Notebooks

The following notebooks are included and if you click on one of the links below, the notebook will be automatically open on MyBinder.org and ready to be run:

* https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks/backtest.ipynb[backtest.ipynb] - How to run a simple backtest, this might be a good starting place if you are new to _roboquant_
* https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks/charts.ipynb[charts.ipynb] - Shows the charting capabilities of roboquant

* https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks/tech-analysis.ipynb[tech-analysis.ipynb] - How to develop technical analysis based strategies
* dotenv - Not a notebook but an example environment file that can hold the keys and secrets which are often required to connect to third party data providers and brokers.


NOTE: the `ibkr` (Interactive Brokers) notebook cannot be run on MyBinder.org since it requires access to a (local) running Trader Workstation or IB Gateway. You can however run it on a local installed Jupyter Notebook.

== Build Docker Image
Check the instructions in the link:/bin/README.adoc[README] in the bin directory on how to build a Docker image from source.

== Contributions
Contributions are greatly appreciated. This can be a fix or enhancement to one of the existing notebooks or a completely new notebook. The best way to do so is to raise an issue on GitHub and afterwards a PR.

Before checking-in, make sure the notebooks don't have any cell output, for example by running the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
cd notebooks
jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace *.ipynb
----
