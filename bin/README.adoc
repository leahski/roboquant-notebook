= Roboquant Docker image

The roboquant docker image includes the following software:
- Jupyter notebook image (`jupyter/base-notebook`) as the base image
- Kotlin kernel for Jupyter
- OpenJDK 17 runtime
- Several Howto notebooks

== Usage
You can start using _roboquant_ with Jupyter Lab straight out-of-the-box by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 roboquant/jupyter
----

Then open the url that appears in your terminal in your browser to try it out. The `./notebooks` directory contains several notebooks that provide an introduction into roboquant.


== Interactive Brokers only
If you also want test the Interactive Brokers Notebook that is included, it is important to realize that the notebook requires access to a (local) running instance of Trader Workstation or IB Gateway (recommended).

For the docker container to have this network accessible, you can use the `--network=host` flag. This will start the container without an isolated virtual network. Of course, you still need to first start the IB Gateway on your local machine.

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 --network=host -roboquant/jupyter
----

You will also have to manually copy the required client jar file after starting a notebook (due to license constraints). See the `ibkr` notebook for more instructions.

== Build Docker Image
You can build the Docker image from the source:

. Clone the roboquant-notebook GitHub repository to your local disk.
. Then run the build script from the repository root directory:
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/dockerbuild.sh
----

The build script has been tested and used with Docker Desktop. By default, this script builds an image for both Intel and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) architectures using the new Docker builder `buildx`. See the `dockerbuild.sh` script if you didn't enable the new builder yet.

Please note the `dockerbuild.sh` script will also push the image to the Docker Hub repository. If you just want to test the docker build on your local machine, you can use the following script instead:

[source,shell]
----
./bin/dockerbuild_singleplatform.sh
----

NOTE: currently, only shell scripts are provided to build and start notebooks. So if you're on Windows you either have to use WSL or run the commands in the shell script from the command line manually.
